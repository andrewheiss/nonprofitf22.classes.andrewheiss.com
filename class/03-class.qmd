## Written response question

Do you think that in practice, a mission statement can ever be truly effective in constraining the expansion of activities of a nonprofit organization? Why or why not? (Answer in â‰ˆ150 words.)


## Team prep work

Write mission and vision statements for your team's nonprofit project to propose to your team. You'll spend class time narrowing down everyone's proposals and consolidating and polishing everything into a single mission statement and vision statement.


## Possible mission, vision, and values guidelines

Here's a rubric I use for evaluating the mission/vision/values statements of nonprofits. You might find it helpful when developing your own organization's mission and vision.
