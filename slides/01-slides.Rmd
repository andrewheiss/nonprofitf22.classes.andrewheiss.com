1. Nonprofits can operate at a profit, but they are not allowed to distribute the profit to shareholders.

2. Major misconception. Every nonprofit has to pay some sort of tax every year.

3. Other than for claims of fraud or, in few cases, contract, donors cannot sue nonprofits for mishandling, misusing, or wasting donated funds. Only the state attorney general can do that.
