*Developing Management Skills: Chapter 9, Teams (part 1)* (from BYU MPA OB class)

At first team members aren't a team, but an aggregation of individuals sharing a common setting - there's uncertainty as to what is going to happen, what is expected, who everyone is, who will lead. No shared history, no unity

Silence, self consciousness, dependence, and superficiality reign supreme

In this stage, in order to overcome all that, a team must:

* Orient members and get questions answered
* Establish trust
* Establish relationships with the leaders
* Establish clarity of purpose, norms, procedures, and expectations

Not a time to rely on free and open discussion and consensus decision making - direction, clarity, and structure are needed

---

# Norming

.box-inv-1.SMALL[Maintain unity and cohesion]

--

.box-inv-1.SMALL[Facilitate participation and empowerment]

--

.box-inv-1.SMALL[Show support to team members]

???

Create team culture, a sense of team - members start to work together, conforming to expectations of other team members, creating team character

522 - Team members work to fit in, support each other, get along

Members begin to value team opinion and goals over personal feelings of cooperativeness

Conformity to standards and expectations, ignoring disagreements

A team must:

* Maintain unity and cohesion
* Facilitate participation and empowerment
* Show support to team members
* Provide feedback on team and member performance

**But**, you **must** move on from this stage, otherwise groupthink sets in and drives out good decision making - no challenge to decisions - too much emphasis on preserving the team rather than making accurate, high quality decisions

]

???

Harmony and success can lead to dissension - "All sunshine makes a desert"

Coalitions and cliques form—there's competition between team members, disagreement with the leader—challenges to others' points of view

Main tasks:

* Manage conflict
* Legitimize productive expressions of individuality
* Turn counterdependence into interdependence
* Foster consensus building process
