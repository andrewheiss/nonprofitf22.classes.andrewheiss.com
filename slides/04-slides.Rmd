???

Business activities - unrelated business income (UBI), if too significant = loss of tax exemption - UBI is always taxable - DI is not generating UBI (that's the point of their organization). If a church newsletter starts selling advertising space, that's UBI. NPR underwriting is special case—sponsors can get exemption. BYU gets tax exemption from selling textbooks, since that fulfills charitable purpose; BYU fudge is UBI.
