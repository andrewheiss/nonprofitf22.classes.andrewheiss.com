> The top 10 organizations reported using 86% of the correct procedures, whereas the bottom 10 use 70% (a difference significant at the .001 level, with a t value of 3.7). The correlation between reported use of prescribed board practices and correct procedures is r = .32 in the restricted sample; the same correlation in the full sample is r = .24. The relation is stronger in the sample of the most and least effective organizations, although the increase is not as great as expected. (p. 157)
