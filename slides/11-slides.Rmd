Not only was access to programs unequal (harder for black veterans to get GI bill benefits in the first place), the implementation of programs was unequal – red lining – FHA loans couldn’t be used in certain neighborhoods, since they were too risky

> Nearly 30 years later, I look around and see many shelters and services for survivors of domestic violence, but no large-scale movement to end male violence. I see many batterer intervention programs, but few men involved in challenging sexism. The loss of vision that narrowed the focus of men's work reflects a change that occurred in other parts of the movement to end violence, as activists who set out to change the institutions perpetrating violence settled into service jobs helping people cope.
